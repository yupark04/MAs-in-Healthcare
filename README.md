This project seeks to explore the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) announcements on the stock prices of healthcare industry companies, focusing on how different types of M&A activities—such as smooth acquisitions versus hostile takeovers—affect shareholder confidence and subsequent stock performance. M&A events are pivotal moments for companies, often reflecting strategic growth or consolidation efforts; however, they bring varying levels of market reaction and can significantly alter a company’s perceived value and stability. Understanding the market response to M&A announcements can help investors, corporate stakeholders, and analysts better anticipate stock movements and manage risk in healthcare investments.
